To use a PS4 DualShock controller with the Pan-Tilt-Mount in stand-alone mode, this is what youâ€™ll need.

ESP32 Dev Kit board - like this one https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B071JR9WS9
DualShock 4 controller


Wiring:

NANO  --  12vPSU  --  ESP32

GND---------GND---------GND

Vin---------12v---------Vin

TX----------------------RX0

RX----------------------TX0



Note: When programming either board, you must disconnect the link between TX and RX. Also, when programming the ESP32 via Arduino IDE, when uploading the program and the IDE says "Connecting", press and hold the "BOOT" button on the ESP32 until the upload starts.
